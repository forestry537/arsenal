    <img src="lacazette.jpg" width="500px">
    <p>Alexandre Lacazette (French pronunciation: ​[alɛksɑ̃dʁ lakazɛt]; born 28 May 1991) is a French professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Arsenal and the France national team. </p>
    <p style="margin-top:10px;">Lacazette came into prominence as a member of the academy at Lyon, where he made his professional debut aged 19. He helped the club win the Coupe de France and Trophée des Champions in 2012, and was named the Ligue 1 Player of the Year in 2014–15.[3] During his time in France, Lacazette cultivated a reputation as a prolific goalscorer and poacher, recording multiple twenty-goal seasons, which earned him a move to Arsenal in a then club-record £46.5 million (€53 million) deal in 2017.[4]</p>
